\problemname{Rainbow Road Race}

Marcy is attending Pride Fest and has signed up to participate in the
Rainbow Road Race. On each street, there are volunteers who have
colored chalk powder. As contestants walk along a street, volunteers
throw chalk onto the contestants. The chalk thrown on each street is one of
the seven colors of the rainbow (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue,
Indigo, Violet).  Once a person starts walking along a street, they
must walk to the end of that street.

The race starts at the \textit{Festival Tent}. The goal of the race is 
to get covered by chalk of every color and come back to the tent. Help 
Marcy determine the shortest distance she has to travel to get every 
color and make it back to the tent.

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains two integers $n$~($7 \leq n \leq 7^3$), 
which is the number of fun locations at the festival, and $m$~($7 \leq m 
\leq 7^4$), which is the number of streets connecting the fun 
locations. The fun locations are numbered $1, \dots , n$ and the 
Festival Tent is location $1$.

The next $m$ lines describe the streets. Each of these lines contains 
three integers $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$~($1 \leq \ell_1 < \ell_2 \leq n$) and 
$d$~($1 \leq d \leq 7^5$), followed by a single character 
$c$~($c$ is one of \texttt{R}, \texttt{O}, \texttt{Y}, \texttt{G}, 
\texttt{B}, \texttt{I}, \texttt{V}). This specifies that this street 
connects locations $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, is $d$ meters long and the 
chalk thrown is color $c$.

It is always possible to travel between any pair of fun locations. There 
is at most one street between any two pairs of locations and each color 
appears at least once.


\section*{Output}

Display the shortest distance Marcy has to travel to get every color 
and make it back to the Festival Tent.
